  NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
    The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean,
 so the right side of the center is a mirror image of the left side.
The area under the normal distribution curve represents probability and the total area under the curve sums to one.
out of 100% 68% of the data is lying on the mean point.
For a perfectly normal distribution the mean, median and mode will be the same value, visually represented by the peak of the curve.
    The normal distribution is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell.
 It is also known as called Gaussian distribution
         A normal distribution is determined by two parameters the mean and the variance.
 A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called a standard normal distribution.
